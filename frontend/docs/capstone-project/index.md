# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid

Welcome to the capstone project of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This project integrates all concepts learned in the previous modules to create a complete autonomous humanoid system.

## Overview

The capstone project demonstrates a complete autonomous humanoid system that integrates all the components learned in the previous modules. You will implement a humanoid robot capable of:

- Understanding natural language commands through voice input
- Perceiving its environment using vision systems
- Planning appropriate actions using cognitive planning
- Executing navigation and manipulation tasks safely
- Responding to environmental changes and unexpected situations

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will demonstrate proficiency in:

1. Integrating Vision-Language-Action systems with ROS2
2. Implementing safe navigation in human environments
3. Creating perception systems for object detection and manipulation
4. Developing fallback behaviors for safe robot operation
5. Deploying a complete robotic system in simulation

## Project Structure

This capstone project includes:

- Complete humanoid robot implementation in simulation
- Voice command processing system
- Cognitive planning and task execution
- Navigation and manipulation capabilities
- Safety systems and emergency procedures
- Comprehensive testing and validation

## Prerequisites

Before starting this project, ensure you have completed:

- Module 1: ROS2 fundamentals and Python control
- Module 2: Simulation environments (Gazebo/Unity)
- Module 3: AI perception systems (NVIDIA Isaac)
- Module 4: Vision-Language-Action integration

Let's begin building our autonomous humanoid robot system.
