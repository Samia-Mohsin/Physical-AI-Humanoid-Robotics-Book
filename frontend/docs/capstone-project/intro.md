# Capstone Project: Autonomous Humanoid Robot

## Overview

The capstone project integrates all the concepts learned throughout this book into a comprehensive, end-to-end humanoid robotics application. Students will design, implement, and deploy an autonomous humanoid robot capable of performing complex tasks using ROS2, Gazebo simulation, NVIDIA Isaac for perception and control, and Vision-Language-Action (VLA) systems.

## Learning Objectives

By completing this capstone project, you will:

- Integrate all components learned in the previous modules
- Design and implement a complete robotic system architecture
- Apply perception, planning, and control algorithms in a cohesive system
- Deploy and test your robot in both simulation and real-world scenarios
- Practice system-level debugging and optimization techniques

## Project Components

The capstone project consists of several interconnected components:

1. **Robot Design & Modeling**: Create a URDF model of your humanoid robot with all necessary sensors and actuators
2. **Perception System**: Implement computer vision and sensor processing using NVIDIA Isaac ROS
3. **Navigation & Planning**: Develop path planning and navigation capabilities using Nav2
4. **Control System**: Implement high-level and low-level control for humanoid locomotion and manipulation
5. **VLA Integration**: Connect Vision-Language-Action models for high-level task understanding
6. **Simulation & Testing**: Test the complete system in Gazebo simulation
7. **Deployment Strategy**: Plan for real-world deployment considerations

## Project Phases

The project is structured in multiple phases, each building upon the previous work:

- **Phase 1**: Robot design and simulation setup
- **Phase 2**: Basic locomotion and sensor integration
- **Phase 3**: Perception system implementation
- **Phase 4**: Navigation and planning integration
- **Phase 5**: VLA system integration
- **Phase 6**: Full system integration and testing
- **Phase 7**: Advanced features and optimization

## Prerequisites

Before starting this capstone project, ensure you have completed:

- All modules in this book
- Hands-on experience with ROS2, Gazebo, and Isaac
- Basic understanding of humanoid kinematics and dynamics
- Familiarity with Python and C++ programming in ROS2 context
