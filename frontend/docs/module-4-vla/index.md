# Module 4: Vision-Language-Action (VLA)

Welcome to Module 4 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on integrating vision, language, and action systems to create robots that can understand and respond to human commands.

## Overview

The Vision-Language-Action (VLA) paradigm enables robots to understand natural language commands, perceive their environment, and execute appropriate actions. In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Create comprehensive VLA system architectures
- Implement voice-to-action pipelines using speech recognition and LLMs
- Develop cognitive planning systems for task decomposition
- Integrate VLA systems with ROS2 actions and Navigation2
- Ground vision and language information for accurate execution
- Implement safety systems and fallback behaviors for reliable operation
- Complete the capstone project of an autonomous humanoid robot

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Design and implement complete VLA systems for humanoid robots
2. Integrate speech recognition, natural language processing, and action execution
3. Create cognitive planning systems that decompose high-level commands
4. Implement safety mechanisms for reliable robot operation
5. Deploy complete autonomous humanoid systems in simulation

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:

- Chapter 1: VLA overview: language → perception → action
- Chapter 2: Voice-to-Action: Mic → Whisper → LLM → ROS2
- Chapter 3: Cognitive Planning: task decomposition
- Chapter 4: Integrating into ROS2 Actions & Nav2
- Chapter 5: Vision + language grounding
- Chapter 6: Safety & fallback behaviors
- Chapter 7: Capstone: Autonomous Humanoid

Let's start by understanding the fundamental concepts of Vision-Language-Action systems.
