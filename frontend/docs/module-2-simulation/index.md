# Module 2: The Digital Twin (Gazebo & Unity)

Welcome to Module 2 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on simulation environments that serve as digital twins for robotic systems.

## Overview

Simulation is crucial for developing and testing robotic systems before deployment on real hardware. In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Set up and configure Gazebo simulation environments
- Convert URDF robot models for use in simulation
- Understand physics concepts including gravity, collisions, and contacts
- Simulate various sensors including LiDAR, depth cameras, IMU, and RGB sensors
- Use Unity for creating realistic visual environments
- Create interactive testing environments for humanoid robots

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Configure and run Gazebo simulations with humanoid robots
2. Create realistic physics environments with accurate collision models
3. Simulate various robot sensors and interpret their data
4. Integrate Unity for enhanced visual rendering
5. Test robot behaviors in safe, simulated environments

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:

- Chapter 1: Gazebo setup
- Chapter 2: URDF → Gazebo pipeline (SDF, controllers, sensors)
- Chapter 3: Physics: gravity, collisions, contacts
- Chapter 4: Sensor simulation: LiDAR, Depth, IMU, RGB
- Chapter 5: Unity for realistic visuals
- Chapter 6: Interactive humanoid testing environments

Let's start by setting up the Gazebo simulation environment.
