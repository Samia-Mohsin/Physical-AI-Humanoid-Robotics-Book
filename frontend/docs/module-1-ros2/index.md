# Module 1: The Robotic Nervous System (ROS 2)

Welcome to Module 1 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2), which serves as the middleware for humanoid robot control.

## Overview

ROS 2 is the communication backbone of modern robotic systems. In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Understand ROS 2 architecture with nodes, topics, services, and actions
- Control robots using Python and the rclpy library
- Create and configure ROS 2 packages, launch files, and parameters
- Work with URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) for robot modeling
- Implement basic control loops for locomotion and manipulation
- Deploy ROS 2 applications on embedded systems like NVIDIA Jetson

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Design and implement ROS 2 nodes for robot control
2. Create custom messages and services for robot communication
3. Model humanoid robots using URDF with joints, links, and sensors
4. Implement basic control systems for robot movement
5. Deploy ROS 2 applications on edge computing platforms

## Module Structure

This module contains the following chapters:

- Chapter 1: ROS2 Architecture - Nodes, Topics, Services, Actions
- Chapter 2: Python rclpy control
- Chapter 3: Packages, Launch files, Parameters
- Chapter 4: URDF: Joints, Links, Sensors
- Chapter 5: Basic control loop (locomotion/manipulation)
- Chapter 6: ROS2 + Jetson deployment

Let's begin with understanding the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture.
