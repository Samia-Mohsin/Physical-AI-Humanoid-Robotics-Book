# Module 3: The AI-Robot Brain (NVIDIA Isaac)

Welcome to Module 3 of the Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics course. This module focuses on AI perception systems and intelligent robot behavior using NVIDIA Isaac tools.

## Overview

Modern robots require intelligent systems to perceive their environment and make decisions. In this module, you'll learn how to:

- Set up NVIDIA Isaac Sim for synthetic data generation and simulation
- Implement Isaac ROS pipelines for vision, SLAM, and perception
- Configure Nav2 for bipedal path planning in complex environments
- Apply reinforcement learning techniques for robot control
- Understand Sim-to-Real concepts for transferring learning from simulation to reality
- Integrate Isaac outputs with ROS2 controllers for seamless operation

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will be able to:

1. Generate synthetic training data using Isaac Sim and USD scenes
2. Implement perception systems using Isaac ROS packages
3. Configure navigation systems for bipedal robots using Nav2
4. Apply reinforcement learning algorithms to robot control problems
5. Bridge the sim-to-real gap for effective robot deployment
