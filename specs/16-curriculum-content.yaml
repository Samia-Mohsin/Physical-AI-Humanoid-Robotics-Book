## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Learning Journey (Priority: P1)

As a student pursuing advanced robotics education, I want to follow a structured curriculum with 7 detailed chapters covering from ROS 2 fundamentals to Vision-Language-Action models, so that I can systematically build expertise in Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics from foundational concepts to cutting-edge applications.

**Why this priority**: This provides the core educational pathway that guides students through the complete learning experience.

**Independent Test**: Students can progress through all 7 chapters in sequence and gain comprehensive knowledge from basic ROS 2 concepts to advanced VLA models.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a beginner in robotics, **When** I start with Chapter 1, **Then** I can progress through all 7 chapters and develop advanced humanoid robotics expertise
2. **Given** I am an experienced roboticist, **When** I browse the curriculum, **Then** I can access specific chapters relevant to my current needs
3. **Given** I want to practice concepts hands-on, **When** I encounter hands-on exercises, **Then** I can complete meaningful projects like deploying controllers or training humanoid models

### User Story 2 - Interactive Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want to interact with live code examples, quizzes, and embedded simulation widgets throughout the content, so that I can practice concepts as I learn them and receive immediate feedback.

**Why this priority**: Interactive elements significantly improve learning outcomes by allowing hands-on practice with concepts.

**Independent Test**: Students can execute live code examples, take quizzes, and interact with simulation widgets to reinforce learning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I encounter a Python/ROS 2 code example, **When** I modify and run the code, **Then** I see immediate results demonstrating the concept
2. **Given** I complete a section, **When** I take the embedded quiz, **Then** I receive immediate feedback on my understanding
3. **Given** I want to visualize complex concepts, **When** I interact with simulation widgets, **Then** I can manipulate parameters and observe effects in real-time

---

### User Story 3 - Multilingual Accessibility (Priority: P2)

As a student who prefers learning in Urdu or Roman Urdu, I want to access the same high-quality technical content in my preferred language, so that language barriers don't impede my understanding of advanced robotics concepts.

**Why this priority**: Multilingual support expands access to advanced robotics education to a broader audience.

**Independent Test**: Students can switch between English, Urdu, and Roman Urdu modes and access the same technical content with accurate translations.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I prefer Urdu, **When** I toggle the language setting, **Then** I can access all 7 chapters in properly translated Urdu
2. **Given** I prefer Roman Urdu, **When** I toggle the language setting, **Then** I can access all 7 chapters in Roman Urdu format
3. **Given** I need technical terminology translated, **When** I view robotics concepts, **Then** complex terms are accurately translated while maintaining technical precision

### Edge Cases

- What happens when live code examples fail to execute in certain environments?
- How does the system handle complex simulation widgets that may not load?
- What occurs when translation services produce technically inaccurate content?
- How does the system handle very long chapters with complex technical content?
- What happens when users try to access content offline?
