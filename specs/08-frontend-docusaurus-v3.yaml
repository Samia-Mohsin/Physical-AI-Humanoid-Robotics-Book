## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Interactive Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

As a student learning Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, I want to interact with the content through live code blocks and quizzes so that I can better understand and practice the concepts as I read.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition of the educational platform - providing interactive learning experiences that improve comprehension and retention.

**Independent Test**: Students can run code examples directly in the browser and get immediate feedback on their understanding through quizzes, delivering immediate educational value.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am reading a chapter with live code examples, **When** I modify the code and execute it, **Then** I see the output immediately in the browser
2. **Given** I have completed a section of content, **When** I take the embedded quiz, **Then** I receive immediate feedback on my answers
