## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Progress Tracking and Dashboard (Priority: P1)

As a student learning Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, I want to track my progress through quizzes and have a dashboard that shows my scores and learning achievements, so that I can monitor my understanding and identify areas that need improvement.

**Why this priority**: Progress tracking is essential for effective learning, providing motivation and clear feedback on comprehension levels.

**Independent Test**: Students can complete quizzes and view their scores and progress on a dashboard page.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I complete a chapter quiz, **When** I submit answers, **Then** my scores are recorded in Neon Postgres and reflected in my progress dashboard
2. **Given** I visit the dashboard page, **When** I view my progress, **Then** I see my quiz scores, completion percentages, and learning achievements
3. **Given** I review past content, **When** I check historical data, **Then** I can see my learning progress over time

### User Story 2 - Interactive Learning Elements (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want to interact with live code examples, quizzes, and visual diagram explanations, so that I can practice concepts hands-on and get immediate feedback to reinforce my learning.

**Why this priority**: Interactive elements significantly improve learning outcomes by allowing hands-on practice with immediate feedback.

**Independent Test**: Students can run live code examples, take interactive quizzes, and get explanations of diagrams to reinforce learning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I encounter a live code example, **When** I modify and execute the code, **Then** I see immediate results that demonstrate the concept
2. **Given** I complete an interactive quiz, **When** I submit answers, **Then** I receive immediate feedback and explanations based on RAG context
3. **Given** I view a technical diagram, **When** I request explanation, **Then** the system provides a detailed explanation using OpenAI Vision capabilities

### User Story 3 - AI-Powered Subagents Assistance (Priority: P2)

As a learner, I want to benefit from AI subagents (Personalizer, Translator, QuizMaster) that dynamically generate personalized content, translations, and quizzes, so that my learning experience is tailored to my specific needs and preferences.

**Why this priority**: AI-powered personalization enhances the learning experience by adapting to individual learning styles, backgrounds, and preferences.

**Independent Test**: AI subagents can dynamically generate personalized content, translations, and quizzes based on user profile and learning progress.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I have a specific learning background, **When** I interact with content, **Then** the Personalizer subagent adapts the content difficulty and examples to my level
2. **Given** I need content in a different language, **When** I request translation, **Then** the Translator subagent provides appropriate translations
3. **Given** I need additional practice, **When** I request more quizzes, **Then** the QuizMaster subagent generates relevant questions based on my progress

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the OpenAI Vision service is unavailable for diagram explanation?
- How does the system handle very large quiz datasets for progress tracking?
- What occurs when live code examples fail to execute in the browser?
- How does the system manage concurrent users accessing the dashboard?
- What happens when subagents are temporarily unavailable?
