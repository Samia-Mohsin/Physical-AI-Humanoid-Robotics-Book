## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Comprehensive Learning Experience (Priority: P1)

As a student learning about Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics, I want to access a structured book with 12 comprehensive chapters covering all essential topics, so that I can build a complete understanding from fundamentals to advanced concepts.

**Why this priority**: This is the core educational experience that provides structured learning from basic concepts to advanced applications.

**Independent Test**: Students can navigate through the 12 chapters in sequence and gain comprehensive knowledge of Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I am a beginner in robotics, **When** I start with Chapter 1, **Then** I can progress through all 12 chapters and develop advanced understanding
2. **Given** I am an advanced learner, **When** I browse the content, **Then** I can jump to specific chapters relevant to my interests
3. **Given** I want to practice what I learn, **When** I encounter interactive elements, **Then** I can engage with live code and quizzes

---

### User Story 2 - Interactive Content Engagement (Priority: P1)

As a learner, I want to interact with live code examples, quizzes, and other interactive elements throughout the book, so that I can practice concepts as I learn them.

**Why this priority**: Interactive elements significantly improve learning outcomes by allowing hands-on practice with concepts.

**Independent Test**: Students can execute live code examples, take quizzes, and interact with content to reinforce learning.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I encounter a live code example, **When** I modify and run the code, **Then** I see immediate results demonstrating the concept
2. **Given** I complete a section, **When** I take the embedded quiz, **Then** I receive immediate feedback on my understanding
3. **Given** I want to access content in different languages, **When** I use translation features, **Then** I can switch between English, Urdu, and Roman Urdu

---

### User Story 3 - AI-Assisted Content Generation (Priority: P2)

As an educator or content creator, I want to use AI subagents to generate high-quality educational content efficiently, so that I can create comprehensive materials with consistent quality and pedagogical value.

**Why this priority**: AI-assisted content generation enables rapid creation of high-quality educational materials while maintaining consistency.

**Independent Test**: The ContentGenerator subagent can create educational content that meets pedagogical standards and technical accuracy requirements.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** I provide content specifications, **When** I use the ContentGenerator subagent, **Then** it produces educational content that is technically accurate and pedagogically sound
2. **Given** I need content in multiple formats, **When** I request generation, **Then** the system creates appropriate MDX files with interactive elements

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when live code examples fail to execute?
- How does the system handle quiz submissions during network outages?
- What happens when AI content generation produces technically inaccurate information?
- How does the system handle translation of highly technical terms?
- What happens when students access content with different screen sizes or devices?
